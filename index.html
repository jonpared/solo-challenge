	<h2>Hip Hop Music</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my page dedicated to my favorite genre of music: Hip Hop. Hip Hop was first formed in the US in the 1970s, and, most would agree, first appeared in New York City. Since then, hip hop has evolved over the past 3 decades becoming a staple in modern music and serving as one of the biggest influences in American culture and society.</p>

		<a href="http://www.sohh.com/">This</a> has always been one of my favorite hip hop sites. 
		<ul>
			<li>This is a great site as it has a clean layout and is easy to navigate.</li>
			<li>It has a lot of ID references as I am assuming that is to identify certain aspects of the page for customization.</li>
			<li>The code is very jumbled and has a lot of scripts. It does not seem to be laid out like the way we were taught. I am assuming those scripts are used to auto-generate the page since it does contain dynamic articles.</li>
